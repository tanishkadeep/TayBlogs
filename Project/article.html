            What we do on the Web changes every day. The web development
            industry is constantly evolving. While we may not be able to tell
            the day-to-day changes while it’s happening, it’s easy for us to
            look back to the past few months and see that a lot of things we do
            now are much different than what we’ve been doing before. Because
            our work lies in one of the fastest-paced industries, it’s important
            for us to predict and learn about what’s coming up or risk being
            left in the web development dust. While this may sound daunting at
            first, it’s actually pretty easy to see where we’ll be in the next
            several months/years to come. Let’s look at some of the things I
            predict are going to happen in the near future.
          </p>

            <span>Less Demand for PSD to XHTML/CSS Conversion Services</span
            ><br />
            As a developer who specializes in PSD to CSS/XHTML conversions, I’ve
            already seen this trend start to happen. While I’m definitely not
            losing business, I’m no longer getting as many regular PSD to
            XHTML/CSS jobs. Most of my jobs currently consist of WordPress
            development or specific and specialized server-side scripting (e.g.
            PHP). In short, web developers are beginning to work more on niche
            jobs such as open source software customization. As the months go
            on, developers like me who charge a premium over “PSD to HTML” chop
            shops are going to need to continue to shift our niche. I believe
            there will always be a demand for this type of work, but you’ll need
            to differentiate yourself from the $50-per-PSD-conversion companies,
            especially if you’re charging significantly more than the “market
            price”.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>More Appreciation for Web Standards</span><br />
            It used to be tough to sell clients on the importance of
            valid/standards-compliant and semantic code, but now, with so many
            devices and browsers on the market, standards have become even more
            important in order to produce flexible and interoperable products.
            With more web browsers supporting open web standards and companies
            chucking out support for proprietary software in favor of open
            technologies, there is a stronger demand — more than ever — for
            coders that are able to work with web standards well. Developers
            that focus on outputting compliant code will benefit from this
            trend.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Less Client Work, More Personal Projects</span><br />
            I’ve noticed that many developers have stopped taking on as much
            client work and have started working on their own projects. With the
            popularity of devices like the iPhone and iPad and public APIs, I
            think this is going to become more common in the next year.
            Personally, I’ve decided to also go this route too, as working on my
            own apps is a lot more fun than working on client sites. Plus, the
            potential for making the next Twitter is always on the horizon, and
            also more attainable with the tools and knowledge that our maturing
            industry has accumulated. Working on your own projects, however,
            offers another benefit. Since the Web evolves so much, you’ll end up
            learning new things that can be incorporated into client work. I’m
            currently learning both PHP and Cocoa, and soon, I’ll be able to
            offer iPhone app development services to clients as well. Doing your
            own projects keeps you updated on the newest stuff.
          </p>

            <span>The Need to Know More Languages and Technologies</span><br />
            It’s not uncommon for web developers to know and work in several
            languages in one page and on one site. I strongly believe that to be
            one of the best in what you do, you need to have a broad scope of
            knowledge and specialize /niche yourself into something quite narrow
            at the same time. I’ve been able to do this successfully by
            specializing in CSS/HTML and offering my services only to other
            freelancers and web design agencies. Quickly though, I’ve been
            getting requests for WordPress work and so I learned the API inside
            and out by jumping right into it. Now, WordPress has become one of
            my specialties and something I enjoy doing for almost every site I
            make. This concept is important in a constantly shifting industry
            like ours and something that’s often missed in college education.
            Many people I went to school with are now without jobs because all
            they can (and want to) do is print design. Our markets are shrinking
            constantly, so it’s important that we continue to learn and have
            other skills in case we need to quickly switch. Knowing other
            languages and technologies also helps keep things interesting and
            avoids burnout.
